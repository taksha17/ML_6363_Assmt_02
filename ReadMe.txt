Summary
The Neural Network Library provides a set of classes and functions for creating and training neural networks. It allows users to easily construct networks with different layer types, define loss functions, and perform forward and backward propagation. The library also supports saving and loading weights, making it convenient for storing and sharing trained models.

Also No need to generate seperate input files, as its an .pynb file and will directly generate the output inside the notebook file itself
